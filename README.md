# Monolithium [![CircleCI][badge]][circleci]

This is my personal little Rails monolith where I keep all the little things
that I've built for myself.

## Update Queue

I feel strongly about keeping my projects up-to-date, so I made a thing to keep
track of which apps are due for an update. It's really just a list of projects
with timestamps to keep track of update state.

## Faring Direball

Due to a quirk in how Gruber does his feed, [Feedbin][feedbin] and other RSS
readers send you to the article he's commenting on instead of his post. I hate
this. So I mirror his feed and remove that quirk so that it links to his post
instead.
